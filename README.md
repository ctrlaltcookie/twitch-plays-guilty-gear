# Hullo :3

Okay so this is hacked together code from a twitch stream where i hacked together some shit to build a twitch plays style application but in the quickest dirtiest way possible

## installs

you'll need to install pynput and twitch_chat_irc

> pip install pynput
> pip install twitch_chat_irc

## how to use

you'll need to connect to your twitch chat by editing line 259 and adding your username where it says your username goes here!

other than that, you'll need to write new custom move parses if you want to change from guilty gear, it's also contingent on my setup for guilty gears buttons:

j punch
u kick
i slash
o heavy slash
l dust
k dash
p taunt
e faultless defense
q roman cancel

a left
d right
s down
space jump
b holds a and s for 2 seconds
w4 holds left for 2 seconds
w6 holds right for 2 seconds

there are a bunch of other nice things, read the code to find out how they work

that's about it, good luck! if you're using this instead of doug dougs i think you've probably made a mistake lmao
